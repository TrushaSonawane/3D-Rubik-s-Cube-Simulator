📄 README.md🧩 3D Rubik's Cube SimulatorA fully interactive and responsive 3D Rubik's Cube simulator built using the powerful Three.js library for rendering and physics, and Tailwind CSS for a modern, sleek interface.✨ FeaturesInteractive 3D Controls: Use your mouse or touch to rotate the entire cube's view using Orbit Controls.Layer Twisting: Click and drag/swipe on any face to perform a 90-degree twist of that layer—mimicking a real-world Rubik's Cube.Scramble Function: Instantly randomize the cube with the SCRAMBLE button, executing a sequence of 25 random moves.Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.Realistic Colors: Uses standard Rubik's Cube color mapping (White, Yellow, Red, Orange, Blue, Green).💻 Technologies UsedThree.js (r128): Core library for creating and rendering the 3D cube.OrbitControls.js: Used for camera manipulation (rotating the view).JavaScript (ES6): Logic for interactions, rotations, and cube state management.HTML5 / CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): Markup and styling for the user interface.⚙️ How It WorksThe core of the simulator is built around Three.js objects and a custom rotation mechanism:Cubie Generation: A $3 \times 3 \times 3$ grid of THREE.Mesh objects (cubies) is created. Materials (colors) are assigned based on their initial position to form the classic solved state.Raycasting for Interaction: A THREE.Raycaster is used to detect which face of which cubie the user has clicked/tapped on.Drag-to-Twist Logic: The onPointerDown, onPointerMove, and onPointerUp handlers track the drag direction (horizontal/vertical swipe) and the clicked face's normal to mathematically determine the correct axis ('x', 'y', or 'z') and direction of the intended 90-degree layer rotation.Pivot Rotation: To animate a layer twist, the relevant 9 cubies are temporarily attached to a single THREE.Object3D (a pivot). This pivot is rotated $90^\circ$ around the required axis.State Update: Once the animation is complete, the cubies are detached from the pivot, and their final rotation and position are snapped to the grid (using cubie.applyMatrix4(pivot.matrix)) to maintain state integrity for the next move.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesYou only need a modern web browser to run the simulator.Installation & Running LocallyClone the repository:Bashgit clone [YOUR-REPO-LINK]
